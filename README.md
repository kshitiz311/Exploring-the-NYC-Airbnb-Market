# Exploring-the-NYC-Airbnb-Market
In this project, we have applied our data importing and cleaning skills to uncover insights into the Airbnb market in New York City.

We imported data from multiple file types and combined them to answer questions about the Airbnb market in New York.  
We also used our string cleaning and date manipulation skills to extract accurate information from the datasets.
